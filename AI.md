# Recording the use of AI in the increment A-AiAssisted

## Tool used

1. GitHub Copilot in VSCode
2. ChatGPT

## What they were used for

1. Learning about a new design pattern that I could apply to my code
    - Had some problems trying to implement the increment BCD-Extension
    - I chose to implement B-DetectAnomalies, where my app had to detect if a task added clashes with another task in the list
    - Problem faced was that I did not know how to implement it without breaking OOP principles (e.g. checking for the type of a class, or downcasting Task into ToDo, Deadline or Event)
    - AI introduced me to the Double Dispatch pattern, and taught me about it

## Observations

The AI used helped me a lot in ensuring I stuck to good OOP principles, and helped me learn a new way to design my code. Without using it, I would have gone ahead with performing type checking instead.
